Perfect your craft Perfecting your craft envelope the areas of music, style of dressing, what you project out, and many more. This is a very delicate time for an artist who has enjoyed the unconditional of mix listeners, being careful of what you dish out is very important. Endeavor your music is what people really need, make sure it connects with the receivers as average music listeners tend to be emotional. Once you passed this test, they automatically fall in love with the particular song, even without spending millions on promotion. 2. Pay promoters I repeat again, pay promoters. You might have been enjoying free space in the music industry but when it is time to donate you have to. For every artiste in this situation, paying promoters is highly essential. Do not underestimate the power of promotion. There is no define sector when it comes to music promotion. You can pay blogs to stick your song for days, pay influencers on social media or pay listeners to vibe to it. Any which way, you have to pay to reach more people, because 5+5 is always 10. Hope you gat me?  3. Create controversy Kizz Daniel unlike most artists is always not controversial, he hardly trends on social media.  I can\u2019t count how many times Davido, Wizkid, and Burna Boy have trended on Twitter in this year that just started, even artists like Rema, Fireboy do sneak into controversy.  I hope you all remember when Rema started saying rubbish on Twitter, the attention is all on him. That\u2019s how to stay relevant as an artist. Find something to say, if there\u2019s no content then purposely drag your colleague. Learn from Burna Boy and Davido commotion. From \u201cfloppy disk\u201d to \u201cyour father buy the whole team\u201d. If not for controversy and trend do you think Zlatan will still be relevant? 4. Be consistent Staying off your pages for a long period of time has no advantage other than reducing your fame to your fans and loved ones. Consistency is not only about engaging or posting content, it also deals with putting up good music from time to time, the interval of the \u201cKing Of Love\u201d album and \u201cCurrency\u201d single is pretty too much. Even if there\u2019s no plan to make music at a particular time, there\u2019s always permission to jump on people\u2019s songs like a cover. Mayorkun did that twice on Zinoleesky\u2019s songs (Mapariwo & Kilofeshe), nobody is too big in this industry. Why do you think Davido stoop so low to jump on Lyta\u2019s Monalisa? It\u2019s still a plus for you. 5. Never feature top artistes Now that Kizz Daniel has featured Olamide and Falz, what is the difference? See, if you\u2019re losing out in this music industry, especially in Nigeria, even a Cardi B\u2018s collaboration won\u2019t revive you. Kizz Daniel\u2018s solo songs have been doing well for a long without any artist\u2019s contribution. Your followers are used to your style, not the other artists you\u2019re bringing in, the best time you can do feature is when you\u2019re still popping not now that you are struggling. The funniest part, a struggling artiste now went a long way to featured loads of struggling artists."},{key:2,title:"BREAKING NEWS!!
